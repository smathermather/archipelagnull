# archipelagnull
No null is an island...

A long time ago, Stephanie May, or @mizmay as she is known on the twittererz, pondered the existence of more than one null island, an archipelago of null islands, or an archipelagnull, if you will.

Jet-lagged from the lovely FOSS4G Korea 2014 and ostensibly preparing his first (real) presentation on OpenDroneMap for FOSS4G Portland, @smathermather undertook the daunting task of mapping out the archipelagnull. It took 20 minutes.

This repository documents in code and in data those discoveries.
